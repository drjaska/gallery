# Why open source is an agile method

Why I am writing about open source when I should speak about free software? Because I want to specifically talk about software development methodology.

Free Software Foundation will usually stress how important it is that software is free and rightly so. It is indeed way more important how a program can be used than how it was originally made.

The argument is, when talking about open source, you are only talking about software development process and not about the outcome. The outcome is what allows NSA to spy you and Facebook to sell your data to whoever. No matter if the development process was "open source" or not.

But the development process actually matters as well. Today I want to talk just about that.

In my opinion free software developers accidentally found an agile software development method. When Linux kernel was created, Torvalds handed code to other people in very early stages of the project. Long before Linux kernel was actually usable, you could compile and use it.

That allowed for a tight *feedback loop*, something that agile development proponents many times stress is important. You don't write your code in vacuum. You write it to the users, and users tell you what they like before you have the code ready.

Another agile principle is developing good enough code. The idea here is you will only add features that are needed. As soon as people find your program useful, you release it and call it a day. Maybe the project then finishes and no more features creep into the project (yeah, sure...)

Does this sound familiar? I know several free software projects that were in a version zero-dot-something for a better part of a decade. I think DosBOX still hasn't released an 1.0 version! That means their code is good enough to use. No one cares they are planning to add something. It is already useful in its present state.

But same goes other way around. There are many closed source, proprietary, non-free software projects that are done in "agile" way. I think all those projects lack certain benefits that the open source development method gives. To be truly agile you must be open.

First and foremost, you are connected to a free software ecosystem. It's no small thing that all (or at least most of) your tools are non-proprietary. Non-proprietary tools give you more freedom to do whatever you want as a developer. Open tool doesn't force you to do anything.

I also do believe proprietaryness allows you to keep shitty stuff hidden. In a free software people notice these things. It's not just backdoors and other nasty stuff. It's also about your configuration file format, your commit message style... Agile development means creating quality software. Quality software does not have shitty stuff in it.

What is my point here? Well, I just think free software is tightly coupled with agile way of thinking. I personally believe agile method is the best method create a good software. Free software is sometimes great in quality because it was made in an agile way.

Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Dennis Ritchie and many others found an agile development method by accident, and started to do that before anyone even knew what agile is. The free software community has some good, agile DNA on it because of that. We should be proud about that. And release early, release often.

Notice I didn't say a word about JIRA or estimation. That's because this text was about agility ;)

By the way, I'm creating my own photo library management tool. It's just an hobby, won't be anything big and professional :) Check it out!
